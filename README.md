# 🛒 Mini eCommerce App (Flutter)

A simple yet functional eCommerce app built using Flutter.  
Not quite ready for Amazon, but it *does* know how to troll the developer who forgot to connect a backend. 😄

---

## 📱 Features

- 🧾 Product listing with hardcoded models
- 📦 Asset-based product images
- 🛍️ Add-to-Cart functionality
- 🛒 Cart screen with list of selected products
- 💸 “PAY NOW” button with a humorous mock alert:
  > *"Hey! User willing to Pay. You connect the app with the payment backend, you idiot!"*

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Flutter widget tree & layout building  
- Using `Provider` for state management  
- Asset handling and image rendering  
- Creating and managing custom models (Product & Cart)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
    https://github.com/BaibhabKarmakar/Ecommerce_app_Flutter

2. **Navigate into the project directory**
   ```bash
    cd Ecommerce_app_Flutter
3. **Install dependencies and run the app**
   ```bash

    flutter run

🤔 What’s Next?
	•	Integrate Firebase or any backend service
	•	Add user authentication
	•	Enable real payment gateways
	•	Dynamic product data instead of hardcoded models

😄 Fun Fact

This app mocks the developer on clicking “Pay Now”—
because hey, learning should be fun!
