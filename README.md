# 🛒 Mini eCommerce App (Flutter)

A simple yet functional eCommerce app built using Flutter.  
Not quite ready for Amazon, but it *does* know how to troll the developer who forgot to connect a backend. 😄

## 📱 Features

- 🧾 Product listing with hardcoded models
- 📦 Asset-based product images
- 🛍️ Add-to-Cart functionality
- 🛒 Cart screen with list of selected products
- 💸 “PAY NOW” button with a humorous mock alert:
  > *"Hey! User willing to Pay. You connect the app with the payment backend, you idiot!"*

- Flutter widget tree & layout building  
- Using `Provider` for state management  
- Asset handling and image rendering  
- Creating and managing custom models (Product & Cart)
